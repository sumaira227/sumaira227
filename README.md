The main objective of solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using artificial neural networks (ANNs) in a project is to approximate and find solutions to complex dynamic systems.
ANNs are employed to model the behavior of systems described by ODEs, providing a data-driven approach to understand and predict the evolution of the system over time.
This method is particularly useful when analytical solutions to the ODEs are difficult or impossible to obtain.
